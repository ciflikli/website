A methodologist and computational social scientist by training, with 17 years of experience in tech, open-source software, and applied research. I hold a PhD from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI) where I remain a Visiting Senior Fellow at the Data Science Institute.

I'm passionate about aligning technical work with business needs to maximise ROI on data initiatives. I publish [TeamCraft](https://teamcraft.substack.com/), a newsletter on technical team management, and write about [MLOps tools in the Python ecosystem](/writing/). I also play bass guitar and have an EP on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5anGntZJaDDBog1XqiSDSj).
