ðŸ‘‹ I'm GÃ¶khan.

I have 15 years of experience working in enterprise, open-source/non-profit ([Quanteda Initiative](https://quanteda.org/)), and academic settings. I am currently the Head of Data & Analytics at a London based tech scaleup. I am also a Senior Visiting Fellow at the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI), LSE.

I enjoy mentoring data engineers, research scientists, and business analysts to maximise their impact. Since 2020, I have been assisting the [Tech Talent Charter](https://www.techtalentcharter.co.uk/home) to run and analyse their annual Diversity in Tech survey.

I am a computational social scientist by training and [publish research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DSwbOtcAAAAJ&hl=en) on gender bias, academic indicators, behavioural interventions in surveys, and armed conflict dynamics.
