A computational social scientist by training, my core expertise lies in robust statistical analysis and explainable predictive modelling. Previously, I held research positions at LSE, UCL, and Uppsala University.

At __Attest__, I focus on building performant Data Science teams that provide technical solutions to business problems. Embedded in cross-functional squads, data scientists at Attest learn how to:

- achieve alignment with Product,
- communicate effectively with Engineering, and
- proactively collaborate with Design.

As a manager, my primary responsibility towards all my team members is to enable and empower them by investing in their growth and providing a safe space for them to be the best version of themselves. I strive to adhere to the points outlined in this Twitter threadðŸ‘‡
