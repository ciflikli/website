A computational social scientist by training, my core expertise lies in robust statistical analysis and explainable predictive modelling. Previously, I held research positions at LSE, UCL, and Uppsala University.

I am currently working on problems in the following domains:

- Non-probabilistic sampling methodology
- Algorithmic bias and structural exclusion in survey data
- Behavioural nudges to promote attention and truthfulness
- Continuous validation of ML models in production
