ðŸ‘‹ I'm GÃ¶khan.

# Who Am I?

I have 15 years of experience working in tech, open-source software development ([Quanteda Initiative](https://quanteda.org/)), and applied research. I currently lead a Data & Analytics function at a London based tech scaleup. I am also a Senior Visiting Fellow at the [LSE Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI), where I spearhead research at the intersection of social policy and generative AI ethics.

# What I Like Doing

I am passionate about aligning technical work with the needs of the business to maximise the ROI on data initiatives. I enjoy mentoring data engineers, research scientists, and business analysts to accelerate their growth.

I publish a weekly newsletter on technical team management aimed at middle managers called [TeamCraft](https://teamcraft.substack.com/). I also post about open-source [MLOps tools in the Python](https://gokhan.io/python) ecosystem. I used to publish case studies on data visualisation and predictive modelling in my [R blog](https://gokhan.io/post), however it lays dormant since 2018.

I support and champion cognitive diversity. Since 2020, I have been assisting the Tech Talent Charter to run and analyse their annual [Diversity in Tech surveys](https://report.techtalentcharter.co.uk/diversity-in-tech).

I am a computational social scientist by training and occasionally [publish research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DSwbOtcAAAAJ&hl=en) on gender bias, academic indicators, behavioural interventions in surveys, and armed conflict dynamics.
