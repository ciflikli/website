Click [here](/Gokhan_Ciflikli_Resume.pdf) for my resume. I am on the market! Contact me for permanent, London-based opportunities with visa sponsorship 🇬🇧

I am a __data scientist__ specialising in __machine learning, time-series forecasting, and natural language processing.__ I am proficient in R, Python, and SQL.

My core expertise lies in

- Time-Series Forecasting: using supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost) to solve binary- and multi-classification problems
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): making sense of unstructured text using web-scraping and industrial solutions (i.e. SpaCy, quanteda)
- Data Visualisation: producing interactive presentations (R-Shiny, reveal.js, D3) to gain insights from data.

Currently, I am a software developer at the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli) at the London School of Economics. As a member of the [Quanteda Initiative](https://quanteda.org/people/), I am responsible for developing a GUI for the [`quanteda`](https://quanteda.io/) package in R. In addition, I am a [research scientist](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495) at Uppsala University working on (in conjunction with the [Research Institutes of Sweden--RISE](https://www.ri.se/en)) the automation of the [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se/) using natural language processing (NLP) and active learning.

Most of my side projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/ciflikli) (work projects are seldomly public, unfortunately). I contribute my blog to [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/).
