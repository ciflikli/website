<p>A computational social scientist by training, my core expertise lies in robust statistical analysis and explainable predictive modelling. Previously, I held research positions at LSE, UCL, and Uppsala University.</p>
<p>At <strong>Attest</strong>, I focus on building performant Data Science teams that provide technical solutions to business problems. Embedded in cross-functional squads, data scientists at Attest learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieve alignment with Product,</li>
<li>communicate effectively with Engineering, and</li>
<li>proactively collaborate with Design.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a manager, my primary responsibility towards all my team members is to enable and empower them by investing in their growth and providing a safe space for them to be the best version of themselves. I strive to adhere to the points outlined in this Twitter threadðŸ‘‡</p>

11 Promises from a Manager: a ðŸ§µ<br><br>1. Weâ€™ll have a weekly 1:1. Iâ€™ll never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel it whenever you like. Itâ€™s your time.
