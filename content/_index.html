<p>I am a <strong>senior data scientist</strong> at <a href="https://www.askattest.com/">Attest</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://quanteda.org/people/">Quanteda Initiative</a> and a <strong>guest lecturer</strong> for the LSE summer school course <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Summer-Schools/Summer-School/Courses/Secure/Research-Methods-Data-Science-and-Mathematics/ME314">Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning</a>.</p>
<p>As a computational social scientist, my core expertise lies in</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Latent variable analysis: using psychometric tools in R, modelling latent traits of individuals to obtain <em>measurements</em></p></li>
<li><p>Predictive modelling: developing machine learning pipelines in Python with an emphasis on robust design and methodology to identify <em>associations</em></p></li>
<li><p>Causal inference: conducting experiments utilising various types of interventions and computing counterfactuals to understand the <em>why</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in analytic software development at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Researchers/Gokhan-Ciflikli">Department of Methodology</a> at the London School of Economics. In addition, I was a <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N19-495">research scientist</a> at Uppsala University working on the automation of the <a href="https://ucdp.uu.se/">Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)</a> using natural language processing (NLP) and active learning.</p>
<p>Most of my side projects are on <a href="https://github.com/ciflikli">GitHub</a>. I contribute my blog to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/">R-Bloggers</a>, a hub for all things R that I have learned a lot from, and <a href="https://rweekly.org/">RWeekly</a>. I am starting a Python data science blog in 2020â€”stay tuned!</p>
