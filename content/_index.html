<p>ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m GÃ¶khan.</p>
<div id="who-am-i" class="section level1">
<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>I have 15 years of experience working in tech, open-source software development (<a href="https://quanteda.org/">Quanteda Initiative</a>), and applied research. Currently, I lead the Data &amp; AI function at <a href="https://www.superside.com/">Superside</a>. Previously, I was Head of Data &amp; Analytics at <a href="https://www.askattest.com/">Attest</a>.</p>
<p>I am also a Senior Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI">LSE Data Science Institute</a>, where I spearhead research at the intersection of social policy and generative AI ethics.</p>

<h1>What I Like Doing</h1>
<p>I am passionate about aligning technical work with the needs of the business to maximise the ROI on data initiatives. I enjoy mentoring data engineers, research scientists, and business analysts to accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>I publish a weekly newsletter on technical team management aimed at middle managers called <a href="https://teamcraft.substack.com/">TeamCraft</a>. I also post about open-source <a href="https://gokhan.io/python">MLOps tools in the Python</a> ecosystem. I used to publish case studies on data visualisation and predictive modelling in my <a href="https://gokhan.io/post">R blog</a>, however it lays dormant since 2018.</p>
<p>I support and champion cognitive diversity. Since 2020, I have been assisting the Tech Talent Charter to run and analyse their annual <a href="https://report.techtalentcharter.co.uk/diversity-in-tech">Diversity in Tech surveys</a>.</p>
<p>I am a computational social scientist by training and occasionally <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DSwbOtcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">publish research</a> on gender bias, academic indicators, behavioural interventions in surveys, and armed conflict dynamics.</p>
<p>I like playing the bass guitar, and recently released a short EP that you can <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5anGntZJaDDBog1XqiSDSj?si=8qzK7eaKQ6-yeBzV0pZjyg">listen to on Spotify!</a></p>
