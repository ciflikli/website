<p>ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m GÃ¶khan.</p>
<p>I have 15 years of experience working in tech, open-source software development (<a href="https://quanteda.org/">Quanteda Initiative</a>), and applied research. I currently lead a Data &amp; Analytics function at a London based tech scaleup. I am also a Senior Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI">LSE Data Science Institute</a>, where I work at the intersection of social policy and AI ethics.</p>
<p>I am passionate about aligning technical work with the needs of the business to maximise the ROI on data initiatives. I enjoy mentoring data engineers, research scientists, and business analysts to accelerate their growth. I publish a weekly newsletter on technical team management called <a href="https://teamcraft.substack.com/">TeamCraft</a>.</p>
<p>I support and champion cognitive diversity. Since 2020, I have been assisting the Tech Talent Charter to run and analyse their annual <a href="https://report.techtalentcharter.co.uk/diversity-in-tech">Diversity in Tech surveys</a>.</p>
<p>I am a computational social scientist by training and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DSwbOtcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">publish research</a> on gender bias, academic indicators, behavioural interventions in surveys, and armed conflict dynamics.</p>
