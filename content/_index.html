<p>A computational social scientist by training, my core expertise lies in robust statistical analysis and explainable predictive modelling. Previously, I held research positions at LSE, UCL, and Uppsala University.</p>
<p>I am currently working on problems in the following domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-probabilistic sampling methodology</li>
<li>Algorithmic bias and structural exclusion in survey data</li>
<li>Behavioural nudges to promote attention and truthfulness</li>
<li>Continuous validation of ML models in production</li>
</ul>
