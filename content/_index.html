<p>I focus on building high-performing Data Science teams that provide technical solutions to business problems. I have experience in leading data scientists and data engineers, both in embedded cross-functional teams and in Centre of Excellence organisational structures.</p>
<p>Regardless of structure, I believe DS can only maximise its potential when it is aligned with Product, closely collaborating with Engineering, and working proactively with Design. I also believe DS/ML is located at the top of the pyramid when it comes to the hierarchy of needs, meaning without robust data governance and infrastructure in place, its value cannot be maximised. Thus, in my role as a data leader, I champion investing heavily in stakeholder management, cross-functional communications, and data engineering.</p>
