<p>I focus on building high-performing Data teams that provide technical solutions to business problems. I have experience in leading data scientists and data engineers, both in embedded cross-functional teams and in Centre of Excellence organisational structures.</p>
<p>Regardless of structure, I believe DS/ML is located at the top of the pyramid when it comes to the hierarchy of needs, meaning without robust data governance and infrastructure in place, its value cannot be maximised. I further believe DS can only maximise its potential when it is aligned with the Product vision, closely collaborating with Engineering, and working proactively with Design &amp; UXR.</p>
