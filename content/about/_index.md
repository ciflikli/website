A methodologist and computational social scientist by training, I have 17 years of experience working in tech, open-source software development, and applied research. I hold a PhD from the London School of Economics where I maintain ongoing connections as a Visiting Senior Fellow at the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI).

I'm passionate about aligning technical work with the needs of the business to maximise the ROI on data initiatives. I enjoy mentoring data engineers, research scientists, and business analysts to accelerate their growth. I support and champion cognitive diversity, and since 2020 I assist the Tech Talent Charter to run and analyse their annual [Diversity in Tech surveys](https://report.techtalentcharter.co.uk/diversity-in-tech).
